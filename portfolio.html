            <h2>Regional CyberSci CTF Competition</h2>
            <p class="date">Date: November 18, 2023</p>
            <p>
                Participating in the Regional CyberSci CTF Event provided an enriching experience alongside universities and colleges across Ontario. 
                Our team achieved a commendable 21st position nationwide and secured the 6th spot within our region. This event served as a valuable 
                opportunity to apply and refine my acquired skills, fostering a deeper understanding of cybersecurity practices. Interacting with 
                fellow participants from the local community further enhanced the event's significance, contributing to a memorable and insightful 
                experience.

            <h2>Hangman Game with Tkinter</h2>
            <p class="date">Date: June 11, 2021</p>
            <p>
                As part of my journey to enhance my Python skills, I set out to develop a project that would consolidate my existing knowledge while also being enjoyable to create. 
                I decided to embark on crafting a graphical hangman game using the Tkinter library in Python. Despite its simplicity in concept, ensuring the visual elements 
                aligned seamlessly with the gameplay proved to be a significant undertaking, requiring careful attention to detail and iterative adjustments. Through this project, 
                I honed my proficiency in Python programming and gained valuable experience in developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Tkinter.

            <p class="date">Date: May 20, 2020</p>
            <p>
                To kickstart my journey with Python, I delved into 'Python Crash Course 2nd Edition' by Eric Matthes. This comprehensive guide served as my gateway to mastering the fundamentals of Python programming. 
                I diligently worked through each chapter, absorbing key concepts and techniques while tackling the exercises provided. Additionally, I undertook supplementary exercises independently to reinforce my 
                understanding and enhance my proficiency in Python.
